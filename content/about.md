ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Welcome to my mind!   Well, at least a portion of it.<br/> <br/>
I'm a software developer by trade and author of this blog by choice. 
The posts here will be somewhat random but will focus on software, microcontrollers, and electronics, with periodic adventures into other areas of interest. 
<br/> <br/>
If you find something useful take a minute to re-post it on you're favorite medium and give me a shout-out.
