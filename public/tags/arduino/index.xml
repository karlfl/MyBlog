      <description>The Netduino series of boards have been around for several decades and saw a limited level of success for the first decade or so. However, as a development ecosystem they haven’t stood the test of time. The original development toolchain has gone into abandonment and been archived. But as a hardware platform, they are a still great boards, especially the Netduino 2 and later, with fully supported mainstream processors. You might not be able to use .Net or C#, but with toolsets from Arduino and STMicroelectronics you can still create amazing things with these easy-to-use Arduino compatible boards. Don’t throw them away! The notes below describe how I rediscovered their usefulness, albeit with a different set of tools.</description>
